		<h2>Jessi Bewley</h2>
		
		<p>M.Ed., LPC-MHSP, NCC</p>

		<p>Jessi could be considered a "Middle Tennessee Gypsy." Born and raised in Lebanon, she moved to Murfreesboro to attend Middle Tennessee State University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in psychology. Jessi then set her sights on Music City to pursue graduate school at Lipscomb University, where she received a Master’s degrees in Professional Counseling. Upon graduation, Jessi immediately went into the counseling field. Jessi's year-long internship at Father Ryan High School counseling students prepared her well for a full time position at Mental Health Cooperative working with adolescents and young adults. Jessi joined Rooted Counseling 3 years ago and has found her calling serving the Nashville community in private practice. Jessi is fully licensed by the state of Tennessee.</p>

    <p>Jessi has many interests outside of work. Jessi would say that she is "a dog lover, an exercise enthusiast and a dancing fool." Jessi loves to hike with her fiancé, Matt, read, and hang out with her dog, Toby.  Jessi believes that traveling is one of the greatest joys in life and finds herself on a beach whenever possible.</p>

    <p>Above all, Jessi is a natural communicator, a skilled therapist, and a lover of people. She believes that counseling is a place where one should feel seen, supported and heard, but also a place to have a little fun. Jessi enjoys using a variety of treatments including cognitive behavioral therapy, person-centered therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. Jessi's greatest reward is helping her clients develop long term skills to live a fulfilling and whole hearted life.</p>

    <p>No one's life is free from ups and downs. We all need a person to help us work through our unique challenges with a listening ear, a kind word, and without judgement. This is what Jessi is all about. </p>
