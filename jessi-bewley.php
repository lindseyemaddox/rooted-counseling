		<h2>Jessi Bewley</h2>
		
		<p>M.S., NCC</p>

		<p>Jessi could be considered a "Middle Tennessee Gypsy." Born and raised in Lebanon, she moved to Murfreesboro to attend Middle Tennessee State University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Jessi then set her sights on Music City to pursue graduate school at Lipscomb University, where she received a Masters degree in Professional Counseling. Upon graduation, Jessi immediately went into the counseling field. Jessi's yearlong internship at Father Ryan High School counseling students prepared her well for her full time position as a mental health counselor at Mental Health Cooperative working with school aged children and adolescents. </p>

		<p>Jessi has many interests outside of work: "I am a dog lover, book lover and dancing fool," she will say. Jessi loves to read, sweat it out at various fitness studios around Nashville, eat ice cream, listen to rock music, travel (especially to beaches!) and hang out with her dog, Toby. </p>

		<p>Above all, Jessi is a natural communicator, a skilled therapist, and a lover of people. She believes that counseling should be a place where one feels supported and heard, but she acknowledges that therapy can also be a place to have a bit of fun. She enjoys using a variety of treatments including cognitive behavioral therapy, person-centered therapy, dialectical behavior therapy and play therapy for her tiniest clients. Jessi’s greatest reward is helping her clients develop the long-term skills to live a fulfilling and wholehearted life. </p>

		<p>No one’s life is free of ups and downs. We all need a person to help us work through our unique challenges with a listening ear, a kind word and without judgment. This is what Jessi Bewley is all about.</p>
