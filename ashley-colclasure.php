		<h2>Ashley Colclasure</h2>

		<p>M.Ed., LPC-MHSP, NCC</p>

		<p>Ashley, the founder and director of Rooted Counseling, has been in private practice since 2010. A native Nashvillian, Ashley moved back to the area after her undergraduate studies at University of Georgia. She attended Vanderbilt University for graduate school and was awarded a Master’s degree in Human Development Counseling from Peabody College. Ashley married a Georgia boy named Ethan in 2008, and they now have three daughters, Townsley, Hazel, and Adelaide.</p>

		<p>Ashley aims to make counseling a safe and comfortable experience for her clients. Once you step into her office, you will feel at home. Though Ashley often uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy in her work with clients, she considers herself an Integrative Therapist, using a variety of counseling modalities as best to meet the needs of each individual.</p>

		<p>Ashley works with clients from a strength-based perspective and specializes in issues like depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, relationship difficulties and adjustment disorder. You will not leave Ashley's office without being asked, “How are you taking care of yourself?”  Ashley models the importance of self-care and the strength of a healthy perspective on a daily basis. When she is not working with clients, you will find her running, doing pilates, cooking, drinking coffee, annoying West Elm employees about design ideas, going on fun dates with Ethan and friends, wandering around Target, or playing at Sevier Park with her baby girls. </p>
 
		<p>Ashley will claim that she has the best job in the world- She loves working with people and cannot believe that she has a career based on building healthy relationships and loving on people during their time of need. Come in, cozy up, and get ready to dig deep. </p>
