		<h2>Ashley Colclasure</h2>

		<p>Ashley Colclasure, M.Ed., LPC-MHSP, NCC</p>

		<p>Ashley, the founder and director of Rooted Counseling, has been in private practice since 2010. A native Nashvillian, Ashley moved back to the area after her undergraduate studies at University of Georgia. She attended Vanderbilt University for graduate school and was awarded a Master’s degree in Human Development Counseling from Peabody College. Ashley married a Georgia boy named Ethan in 2008, and they now have two daughters, Townsley and Hazel.</p>

		<p>Ashley aims to make counseling a safe and comfortable experience for her clients. Once you step into her office, you will feel at home. Though Ashley often uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy in her work with clients, she considers herself an Integrative Therapist, using a variety of counseling modalities as best to meet the needs of each individual.</p>

		<p>Ashley works with clients from a strength-based perspective and specializes in issues like depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, relationship difficulties and adjustment disorder. You will not leave Ashley's office without being asked, “How are you taking care of yourself?”  Ashley models the importance of self-care and the strength of a healthy perspective on a daily basis. When she is not working with clients, you will find her running, doing pilates, cooking, drinking coffee, annoying West Elm employees about design ideas, going on fun dates with Ethan and friends, wandering around Target, or playing at Sevier Park with her baby girls. </p>
 
		<p>Ashley will claim that she has the best job in the world- She loves working with people and cannot believe that she has a career based on building healthy relationships and loving on people during their time of need. Come in, cozy up, and get ready to dig deep. </p>

		<h2>Jessi Bewley</h2>

		<p>Jessi could be considered a "Middle Tennessee Gypsy." Born and raised in Lebanon, she moved to Murfreesboro to attend Middle Tennessee State University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Jessi then set her sights on Music City to pursue graduate school at Lipscomb University, where she received a Masters degree in Professional Counseling. Upon graduation, Jessi immediately went into the counseling field. Jessi's yearlong internship at Father Ryan High School counseling students prepared her well for her full time position as a mental health counselor at Mental Health Cooperative working with school aged children and adolescents. </p>

		<p>Jessi has many interests outside of work: "I am a dog lover, book lover and dancing fool," she will say. Jessi loves to read, sweat it out at various fitness studios around Nashville, eat ice cream, listen to rock music, travel (especially to beaches!) and hang out with her dog, Toby. </p>

		<p>Above all, Jessi is a natural communicator, a skilled therapist, and a lover of people. She believes that counseling should be a place where one feels supported and heard, but she acknowledges that therapy can also be a place to have a bit of fun. She enjoys using a variety of treatments including cognitive behavioral therapy, person-centered therapy, dialectical behavior therapy and play therapy for her tiniest clients. Jessi’s greatest reward is helping her clients develop the long-term skills to live a fulfilling and wholehearted life. </p>

		<p>No one’s life is free of ups and downs. We all need a person to help us work through our unique challenges with a listening ear, a kind word and without judgment. This is what Jessi Bewley is all about.</p>
