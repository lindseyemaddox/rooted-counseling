		<h2>Rae Anne Everts</h2>
		
		<p>M.M.F.T.</p>

		<p>Though Rae Anne was raised in the North, she has lived in the South for the past 9 years. She obtained her Bachelor’s Degree from Bradley University and immediately began working in the fashion industry in Chicago. After a few years in the corporate world, she began working for the Young Life Organization in Atlanta, Georgia. Her vision for pursuing her graduate counseling degree first became apparent while taking a counseling course during seminary. Due to expected life events, however, this vision would not take root for years to come.</p>

		<p>When Rae Anne moved to Nashville in 2010, she became a part of a non-profit organization where she traveled to Africa several times. During her last trip to Africa, she felt the urge to pursue counseling, with the hope that one day she could return to provide therapy to those in need. She worked at Monroe Harding as a therapist intern, which affirmed her desire to work with children, adolescents and families. She graduated from Trevecca Nazarene University with a Master’s Degree in Marriage and Family Therapy in 2015.</p>

		<p>Although Rae Anne loves her role as a therapist, she also enjoys running and yoga as well.  She is a certified yoga instructor and loves teaching yoga all over Nashville. She also loves spending time with her family, friends, and her puppies, Paul Simon & Bennett Terrell. The beach in Naples is her favorite spot because she feels most at peace and close to her late brother, Paul.</p>
 
		<p>Rae Anne takes a holistic approach in therapy, incorporating several therapeutic theories, such as attachment, experiential, narrative, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Her passion is to help and encourage individuals in knowing that they are valued, worthy, and that there is hope. She looks forward to meeting with you, and she feels privileged to be a small part of your “BIG STORY!”</p>
