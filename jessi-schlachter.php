		<h2>Jessi Schlachter</h2>
		
		<p>M.Ed., LPC-MHSP, NCC</p>

		<p>Jessi could be considered a "Middle Tennessee Gypsy." Born and raised in Lebanon, she moved to Murfreesboro to attend Middle Tennessee State University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in psychology. Jessi then set her sights on Nashville to pursue graduate school at Lipscomb University, where she received a Master’s degree in Professional Counseling. Upon graduation, Jessi immediately went into the counseling field. Jessi worked at Mental Health Cooperative for 3 years as a school based therapist. During this work, Jessi discovered her love of working with adolescents and young adults. Jessi is also passionate about working with “20 somethings” and feels that her skill set and personality speak directly to this age which can be full of transitions and bumps in the road. Jessi joined Rooted Counseling 4 years ago and has found her calling serving the Nashville community in private practice.</p>

    <p>Jessi has many interests outside of work. Jessi would say that she is "a dog lover, an exercise enthusiast and a dancing fool." Jessi loves to hike with her husband, Matt, read, cook delicious meals, and do lots of yoga. Jessi believes that traveling is one of the greatest joys in life and finds herself on a beach whenever possible.</p>

    <p>Above all, Jessi is a natural communicator, a skilled therapist, and a lover of people. She believes that counseling is a place where one should feel seen, supported and heard, but also a place to have a little fun. Jessi enjoys using a variety of treatments including cognitive behavioral therapy, person-centered therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. Jessi treats clients with issues such as anxiety, depression, life transitions, relationship issues, and helps clients with general life guidance. Jessi's greatest reward is helping her clients develop long term skills to live a fulfilling and whole hearted life.</p>

    <p>No one's life is free from ups and downs. We all need a person to help us work through our unique challenges with a listening ear, a kind word, and without judgement. This is what Jessi is all about.</p>
