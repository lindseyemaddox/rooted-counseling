	<p>Rooted Counselors have reserved a finite number of sliding scale clients in their caseload, so do not hesitate to ask your counselor if you think you may qualify.</p>

	<p>Rooted Counseling <span class="emphasis">does not</span> accept any type of insurance, though clients may seek reimbursement for counseling services on their own. If a client choses to seek reimbursement from their insurance company, their counselor will give the client an appropriate diagnosis to turn in to their insurance company.</p>
