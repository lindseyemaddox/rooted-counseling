		<h2>Settle in</h2>

		<p>The counselors at Rooted pride themselves in making their offices comfortable, welcoming, and warm environments. They recognize that if their client feels uncomfortable in their surroundings, they will have more difficulty connecting on a therapeutic level.</p>

		<h3>...and expect to build relationship</h3>

		<p>The relationship between the counselors at Rooted and their clients is seen as one of the most important parts of therapy. “If we don’t have relationship, we have nothing.”</p>

		<h3>...with experienced professionals</h3>

		<p>Rooted Counseling takes great care in hiring only the most seasoned therapists. The pursuit of licensure in the State of Tennessee is a stringent process, requiring all licensees to attain (at least) 2 years of supervision after his or her 3 or more years of graduate studies. While most therapists at Rooted are already licensed, a select few are undergoing supervision towards licensure to provide the best care for their clients.</p>

		<h3>...that use empirically supported therapy techniques</h3>

		<p>Rooted counselors aren’t just shooting in the dark. Though they recognize that the relationship is an integral part of the therapeutic relationship, they also know the importance of using therapy techniques that have been researched and proven successful. </p>
		
		<h3>...to facilitate lasting change.</h3>
